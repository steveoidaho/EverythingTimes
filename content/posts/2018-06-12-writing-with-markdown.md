Markdown is a common plain text markup format which aims to be human-readable without any processing required. Its format is similar to conventions often found in plain text emails.

Here are some examples:

* **bold** is typed as `**bold**`
* *italic* is typed as `*italic*`
* lists are entered with  asterisks, hyphens, or plus signs:

  ```
  * here is my markdown list
  + here is another item
  - a third item
  ```
* if you want to quote someone, it's just like an email:
  > what is your problem?
